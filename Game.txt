You to speak to a hurrying student. The student runs into you and falls to the ground. The student quickly 
gets up and apologizes to you, asking if you are okay. You are sturdier than you look and you're undamaged. 
I'm so sorry, I was in such a hurry that I didn't see you there... Say, I haven't seen you here before. 
You're new here aren't-cha?" the student winks at you, "Don't worry, there's tons of newbies around today, 
why don't you try checking out one of the free intro lessons? I'd show you where to go, but I gotta run to 
class. Just head into the Lessons hall and someone should help you out. See you around." The student runs 
past you. You notice that the student is pretty cute, and probably around your age. Unfortunately, the 
student disappears around a corner before you can ask for a name.

It then grows tired of having you as a burden and knocks you off. He then looks towards the east as if

"Hello adventurer! Top of the morning to you! You seem like a young and energetic explorer. If you're brave 
enough, your destiny awaits within this cave. That destiny will manifest itself as a portal. Enter this 
portal and begin the next chapter of your life." 
The old man sees the shock on your face and smiles a comforting smile, "I am but a fragile old man, and 
cannot accompany you through this cave, but what I can provide are a few simple spells that will help you 
along your way. Just read my old manuscripts and tryout those spells."

If you so desire, you can add a new MagicLocker outside your Home. In this MagicLocker you can find some 
tools that will be useful in your time at MIT (and beyond). There you can find portals to other places, you 
can write notes, and you can store various items you collect in your travels in the MagicLocker. But first 
you need to go to the AthenaCluster and learn how.

The Workstation has resources you can use to access files in a joint Athena locker. It adds new rooms (when 
they're in your Home we call them lockers) to your Home, and you can add them to your collection of lockers 
if you have permission. If you know what you want to add to your Home (the name of the locker you want, of 
course), just 'add LOCKERNAME'. It gives you extra spells (if you learn them), and gives you more Rooms to 
explore.
